= OpenShift Disconnected Workshop

Welcome to the OpenShift **__Disco__**nnected Workshop!

ðŸª© ðŸ’ƒ It's DISCO time! ðŸ•º ðŸª©

In this workshop you will: learn about, prepare for, install and operate an OpenShift 4 cluster in a disconnected network.
This is also known as installing OpenShift in a https://docs.redhat.com/container-platform/{openshift_version}/installing/installing_aws/installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned.html#installation-about-restricted-networks_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[_restricted network_ or an _air gap network_,window=_blank].

The workshop environment (illustrated below) gives you access to several systems in different networks.

The instructions and environments were created using OpenShift version `{openshift_min_version}`.

[TIP]
--
The term _disconnected network_ can mean different things to different people.

This workshop describes one particular way of performing a disconnected installation.
Another way would be to setup, secure, and use a proxy server.
You could also install OpenShift with a temporary connection to the installation resources and remove the access later.

== Who uses disconnected networks?

Before we begin let's consider a few use-cases for disconnected networks:

* *Military & Law Enforcement*: Often need secure environments to handle sensitive data
* *Research Organizations*: Want to protect their data & provide data governance
* *Industrial / Utilities*: Use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA[SCADA,window=_blank] networks to protect their supervisory and control machinery

== Understanding our lab environment

The diagram below illustrates the various systems, networks and connections your workshop environment provides.
The diagram will be simplifed and explained in more detail later.
The workshop instructions will help you prepare the [.lowside]#jump system# to download the installation content, setup the [.highside]#highside system# to serve the content, and create the [.highside]#disco.lab# OpenShift cluster -- which doesn't exist yet.

The [.salsa]#salsa network# and its systems were built automatically when the workshop environment was created.
You can log into the [.salsa]#salsa systems# to compare your systems with functional disconnected systems.

=== Lab Access and Documentation notes

[%hardbreaks]
The terminal to your right is already logged in to the [.lowside]#jump system's# *SSH Terminal*.
The right-hand side of this browser can also show the [.lowside]#jump system's# graphical desktop by clicking on the *Desktop* button.

The lab instructions should be run as the user named `{bastion_ssh_user_name}`.

Commands that should be run on the [.lowside]#jump system# will appear in this color.

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
echo 'Run this command on the "jump" system'
echo 'The jump system is also known as the "lowside" system'
----

Commands that should be run on the [.highside]#highside system# will appear in this color.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
echo 'Run this command on the "highside" system'
----

[TIP]
--
Use the *Copy* button in the corner of the command boxes to your advantage!

[%hardbreaks]
Press **Ctrl + Shift + V** to paste.
Using **Ctrl + Insert** (copy) and **Shift + Insert** (paste) also works.
--

[NOTE]
--
The workshop instructions intentionally avoid asking you to use `vi`, `nano`, or `emacs` to edit text files.
The authors of the workshop want you to focus on the material instead of the strange incantations required to save and quit out of `vi`, `nano` or `emacs`.

=== Alternate connection methods

If you prefer to use your own terminal, you can log into the [.lowside]#jump system# using SSH like this:

[.output,subs="attributes"]
----
# Your unique SSH password is {bastion_ssh_password}
----
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{bastion_ssh_command}
----

If you prefer to use your own VNC viewer, you can connect to the [.lowside]#jump system's# graphical desktop like this:

[.output,subs="attributes"]
----
# Your unique VNC password is {bastion_ssh_password}
----
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
vncviewer {JumpInstancePublicIp}
----
