= Appendix: Lab Details

== Pull Secrets [[pull-secret]]

A **_pull secret_** is JSON-formated data that combines authentication information for one or more Image Registries into a single file.
You can find your own _pull secret_ in the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console,window=_blank].

Connected cluster's, and systems that use `oc-mirror` to download the OpenShift installation images, are required to have valid authentication for the quay.io registry. The other registries in your __pull secret__ allow your OpenShift cluster to build a sample application catalog for your developers, fetch official content from Red Hat, and participate in the Insight monitoring service.

The __pull secret__ of a disconnected cluster is only required to have authentication details for the `mirror-registry` and any other registries that your applications depend upon.

OpenShift provides a __global pull secret__, and allows individual `namespaces` / projects to create their own __pull secrets__. It is not allowed to have multiple authentication for a single registry (e.g. defined in the __global__ and __namespaced pull secrets__.)

The `jq` tool makes it easy to inspect and reformat the contents of a __pull secret__.
And you can add and remove entries in a __pull secret__ using `podman`.

[TIP]
--
The __"auth"__ string is base64-encoded data.
If you decode the string you will see that it says `username:password`
--

The `install-config.yaml` file doesn't allow multi-line __pull secrets__.
You can collapse / condense / compact multi-line JSON with `jq -c`

== Two ways to `oc-mirror` - Partially Disconnected -vs Fully Disconnected
The `oc-mirror` plugin supports two mirroring scenarios.

If your network security allows it, `oc-mirror` can simultaneously download the OpenShift installation images and upload it into the [.highside]#`mirror-registry` in the disconnected environment#.

This is documented as a https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{openshift_version}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#mirroring-image-set-partial[partially disconnected environment,window=_blank].

The other scenario, described in this workshop, requires `oc-mirror` to download the OpenShift installation images into a .tar file on a [.lowside]#lowside system#.

After the .tar file is created, it must be moved into the [.highside]# highside disconnected environment#.

Another instance of `oc-mirror` will open the .tar file and upload the contents into the `mirror-registry`.

This is documented as a https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{openshift_version}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#mirroring-image-set-full[fully disconnected environment,window=_blank].


== Proxy [[proxy]]

The [.highside]#highside network# restricts outbound traffic with a http://www.squid-cache.org/[Squid proxy] running on the `nat system`.
The `nat system / proxy` prevents any egress traffic not listed in its `/etc/squid/whitelist.txt` file.

Note that access from the [.highside]#highside systems# to quay.io, openshift.com, and redhat.com is **DENIED**.

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute]

ssh nat "sudo cat /etc/squid/whitelist.txt"

There may be situations where you wish to add more exceptions here, such as container or package repositories.

Now that our air gap is in place, let's start prepping the low side.


== `openshift-install` details

The OpenShift installation process is initiated from the *highside* server.
There are a handful of different ways to install OpenShift, but for this lab we're going to be using installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI).
By default, the installation program acts as an installation wizard, prompting you for values that it cannot determine on its own and providing reasonable default values for the remaining parameters.
After the wizard portion of `openshift-install` completes, you then customize the `install-config.yaml` file that was produced to specify the disconnected pieces.
With the standard values and the disconnected values added to the `install-config.yaml` file, `openshift-install` can automatically provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.

Examples of the __underlying infrastructure__ include:

* Virtual Machines / Cloud instances
* DNS records
* Firewall / Security Groups
* Load Balancers
* IAM permissions that allow the cluster to scale and self-heal

[TIP]
You may notice that nodes are provisioned through a process called _Ignition_.
This concept is out of scope for this workshop, but if you're interested to learn more about it, you can read up on it in the documentation https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{openshift_version}/html/architecture/architecture-rhcos#ignition-sequence_architecture-rhcos[here].

IPI is the recommended installation method in most cases because it leverages full automation in installation and cluster management, but there are some key considerations to keep in mind when planning a production installation in a real world scenario.

* *You may not have access to the infrastructure APIs.* Our lab is going to live in AWS, which requires connectivity to the `.amazonaws.com` domain to talk to AWS, as well as the `.aws.ce.redhat.com` domain to talk to Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI).
We accomplish this by using an _allowed list_ on a Squid proxy running on the high side, but a similar approach may not be achievable or permissible for everyone.
We'll discuss this further later in the lab.
* *You may not have sufficient permissions with your infrastructure provider*.
Our lab has full admin in our AWS enclave, so that's not a constraint we'll need to deal with.
In real world environments, you'll need to ensure your account has the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{openshift_version}/html-single/installing_on_aws/index#installation-aws-permissions_installing-aws-account[appropriate permissions] which sometimes involves negotiating with security teams.

Once configuration has been completed, we can kick off the OpenShift Installer and it will do all the work for us to provision the infrastructure and install OpenShift.
Here's a diagram describing everything we've discussed so far:
