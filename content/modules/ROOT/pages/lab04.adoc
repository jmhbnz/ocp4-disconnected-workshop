= Install OpenShift

You're almost there!

In this section you will create an `install-config.yaml` __"answer file"__ that the OpenShift Installer `openshift-install` will use to automatically create your disconnected [.highside]#openshift.disco.lab cluster#.

Installing OpenShift in a disconnected environment is as easy as adding three extra pieces of information to an `install-config.yaml`.

{counter:overview}. Provide your disconnected `pull secret`

{counter:overview}. Identify your disconnected `mirror-registry`

{counter:overview}. Trust the `mirror-registry's` TLS certificate

[NOTE]
--
We will also create an SSH key that can be used for debugging.
But nothing will go wrong, so we won't use it! ðŸ˜Š

Creating and SSH key is not required for any OpenShift installation, connected or disconnected, but it's a good idea to include one just in case...
--

The diagram below is a reminder that your [.highside]#disco.lab cluster# is completely disconnected from the public internet.
Aside from communicating with the AWS Cloud APIs to create its own DNS records, instances, and security groups -- your cluster is completely disconnected and will install from [.highside]#highside's mirror-registry#.

== Create the install-config.yaml

Instead of answering `openshift-install's` questions via its interactive wizard, this workshop shows you how to create the `install-config.yaml` __answer file__ from a template.

The template below provides the Amazon AWS cloud `region` and `subnet` values that are [.underline]#unique to your environment#.
The template also provides the DNS name (`disco.lab`) that OpenShift will use and tells `openshift-install` to create a Single Node Openshift (SNO) cluster by setting `compute.replicas` to `0` and `controlPlane.replicas` to `1`. Question, is a cluster of 1 still a cluster? ðŸ¤·

[WARNING]
--
Do not change any values in the `install-config.yaml` template below.

[TIP]
--
Make sure the `tmux` pane that you're using is logged in to the [.highside]#highside# system.

You may have to `ssh highside` if the only available `tmux` pane is still connected to the [.lowside]#jump# system.

Don't forget to hit Enter/Return after pasting this beautiful block of text.

=== Pull Secret

image::install-config-3.svg[initial config,width=600]

Your disconnected __pull secret__ contains the username and password for the `mirror-registry`.
However, the __pull secret__ created by `podman login` stores that information on multiple lines.
The `install-config.yaml` file expects your __pull secret__ to be on a single line.

Use `jq` to minify your __pull secret__ and add it to the `install-config.yaml`

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
echo "pullSecret: '$(jq -c . $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json)'" | tee -a /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
----
[.output]
----
pullSecret: '{"auths":{"ip-10-0-56-192.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal:8443":{"auth":"aW5pdDpkaXNjb3Bhc3M="}}}'
----

[NOTE]
--
Downloading the OpenShift installation images requires a _pull secret_ from the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console,window=_blank].
That __pull secret__ provides credentials for several Red Hat image registries, including quay.io and registry.redhat.io.

The __pull secret__ that gets added to a disconnected installation's `install-config.yaml` is only required to provide credentials for the `mirror-registry`.
--

=== Add imageContentSources

image::install-config-4.svg[initial config,width=600]

We will be using what was generated by `oc-mirror` to ensure that the cluster uses our disconnected mirror for container images running on the [.highside]#highside# system.

When `oc-mirror` is done uploading the OpenShift installation images into the `mirror-registry` it creates several __results files__.
The contents of the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` __result file__ must be added to the `install-config.yaml` __answer file__.

[WARNING]
Use the following command to check if `oc-mirror` on the [.highside]#highside# system has finished uploading the installation images.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
if (test -e /mnt/high-side-data/oc-mirror-workspace/results-*/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml)
  then
     echo -e "\n\n Looks good, go ahead! \n\n"
   else
     echo -e "\n\n Uh oh, something is wrong... \n\n"
fi
----

[WARNING]
--
If the check command said that something is wrong, please make sure that `oc-mirror` has finished uploading.

If the `oc-mirror` upload completed successfully, and the check command still says something is wrong, it's possible that your __results files__ were written to a different directory.
Look for a directory called `oc-mirror-workspace` on your [.highside]#highside# system.
Or ask a lab assistant for help.
--

When the check command says that everything looks good, you can add the `imageContentSources:` data to your `install-config.yaml` with the following command.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF >> /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
imageContentSources:
$(grep "mirrors:" -A 2 --no-group-separator /mnt/high-side-data/oc-mirror-workspace/results-*/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml)
EOF
----

Confirm that the `imageContentSources` were added to the bottom of your `install-config.yaml` with this command.
And that the output looks similar to the example below.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
tail -22 /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
----
[source,yaml]
----
imageContentSources:
  - mirrors:
    - ip-10-0-56-192.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal:8443/openshift/release-images
    source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
  - mirrors:
    - ip-10-0-56-192.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal:8443/openshift/release
    source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
----

The `imageContentSources:` lines tell OpenShift that its installation images should be pulled from your `mirror-registry` instead of from quay.io

=== Trust the mirror-registry's TLS certificate

image::install-config-5.svg[initial config,width=600]

Now that your `install-config.yaml` includes the location and credentials for your `mirror-registry`, the last step is to add the `mirror-registry's` TLS Certificate Authority (CA) data.

Add the Root CA of your `mirror-registry` to the `install-config.yaml` file by running this command:

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF >> /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
additionalTrustBundle: |
$(sed 's/^/  /' /home/lab-user/quay-install/quay-rootCA/rootCA.pem)
EOF
----

It will look something like this, including the 2 spaces of indentation, when we inspect the finished `install-config.yaml` in the next step.

[source,yaml]
----
additionalTrustBundle: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

=== Review the install-config.yaml

Please take a moment to inspect your `install-config.yaml` file for the sections that were added in this lab.

[TIP]
--
[%hardbreaks]
`tmux` has been setup for "mouse mode" which allows you to scroll up and down with the mouse wheel.
After scrolling up, you can quickly get back to the bottom by pressing `q`, as in `quit`
--

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml
----

In addition to the base template, you should have sections for:

{counter:inspect}. SSH key under `sshKey:`

{counter:inspect}. Pull Secret under `pullSecret:`

{counter:inspect}. Mirror Registry under `imageContentSources:`

{counter:inspect}. Mirror Registry Certificate Authority under `additionalTrustBundle:`

[NOTE]
--
Please make a backup of your `install-config.yaml` because `openshift-install` will consume it / delete it.
--

Make a backup of your perfect `install-config.yaml`.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
cp -v /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml /mnt/high-side-data/install-config.yaml.backup

== Running the Installation

With all of the installation questions answered, `openshift-install` can now automate the installation of your disconnected cluster.
Let's kick off your disconnectd OpenShift installation!

image::install-config-6.svg[initial config,width=600]

Run the `openshift-install` command.
The command below includes the directory where your `install-config.yaml` __answer file__ is located.

[.highside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
openshift-install create cluster --dir /mnt/high-side-data
----
[.output]
----

----

[IMPORTANT]
This `disco.lab` OpenShift cluster will take about 30 minutes to install.

Please go on to the next section and work with the pre-built [.salsa]#salsa.lab cluster# while the installation completes.

[NOTE]
--
The OpenShift Installer (`openshift-install`) is specifically built for every version / release of OpenShift.

This means that `openshift-install` version `{openshift_min_version}` will install OpenShift `{openshift_min_version}`.
It also means you can't use `openshift-install` version `{openshift_min_version}` to install OpenShift `{openshift_max_version}`.
