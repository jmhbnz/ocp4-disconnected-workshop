= Disconnected Overview

Let's start with an overview of OpenShift's disconnected installation process.
You can refer to the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{openshift_version}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#installing-disconnected-environments[OpenShift documentation,window=_blank] for more details.

**The disconnected installation steps are:**

{counter:steps}. Prepare a system ([.lowside]#jump#) that can download the mirroring tools and the OpenShift installation images

** Use `oc-mirror` to download the installation images

{counter:steps}. Move the mirroring tools and installation images from the [.lowside]#jump system# to the [.highside]#highside system#

** We'll use `rsync` in this workshop
** Many people use DVDs or USBs to walk content between systems and over air gaps
*** This is known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet[👟 _sneaker net_ 👟,window=_blank]

{counter:steps}. Setup a system ([.highside]#highside#) that can serve the installation images in the disconnected network

** Install the `mirror-registry`
** Use `oc-mirror` to populate the `mirror-registry`

{counter:steps}. Tell the OpenShift Installer (`openshift-install`) where to find the installation images

** Add three additional sections to the `install-config.yaml` file
*** Add the `mirror-registry` as an approved mirror / installation source
*** Add credentials (`pull secret`) for the `mirror-registry`
*** Trust the TLS certificate of the `mirror-registry`

{counter:steps}. After OpenShift has been installed...

** Tell OpenShift where to look for apps / Operators
** Tell OpenShift where to look for updates

Now that we know the procedure, let's start with **Step 1 - Preparing the [.lowside]#jump system#**

== Preparing the jump system

The [.lowside]#jump system# lives in the [.lowside]#lowside network# which allows it to download the mirroring tools and installation images.
The network is called [.lowside]#lowside# because it has a low security profile, and shouldn't be used to store sensitive information.

=== Download Mirroring Tools

OpenShift provides two primary tools that are used to create disconnected clusters:

{counter:tools}. `oc-mirror` - A tool to help you download:

** The OpenShift installation images (a specific set of container images)
** Additional container images such as `docker.io/wordpress`
** Individual Operators like the Web Terminal, the DISA STIG Compliance Operator, etc...
** Helm charts like `csi-driver-nfs`

{counter:tools}. `mirror-registry` - An _image registry_ that serves container images to the OpenShift nodes

** This is a https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{openshift_version}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#installing-mirroring-creating-registry[smaller & streamlined,window=_blank] version of the Red Hat Quay Image Registry

We will also download two additional tools that will be used later on the [.highside]#highside system#.

{counter:tools}. `openshift-install`: The OpenShift Installer

{counter:tools}. `oc`: The OpenShift command line interface

[NOTE]
--
OpenShift 4.10 introduced `oc-mirror` as a new tool to download OpenShift content.
The previous tool, `oc adm release mirror ...`, is still available but not recommended.

[%hardbreaks]
`oc-mirror` allows you to download additional images, Helm charts, and individual Operators.
`oc-mirror` also intelligently downloads only the changes when updates are downloaded.
--

[NOTE]
--
Disconnected OpenShift installations can use any _image registry_ that supports the Docker v2 API, [.underline]#provide TLS encryption#, and [.underline]#require authenticated image pulls#, such as:

* Harbor
* JFrog Artifactory
* Sonatype Nexus Repository
* Red Hat Quay Registry (enterprise)
--



[TIP]
--
Click the *Copy* button to quickly grab all of the commands in the code blocks.

[%hardbreaks]
Press **Ctrl + Shift + V** to paste.
Using **Ctrl + Insert** (copy) and **Shift + Insert** (paste) also works.

The pasted commands won't run immediately.
You must to hit Enter/Return yourself.
--

[%hardbreaks]
Please begin by changing your directory to `/mnt/low-side-data/`
Then use the following commands to download and extract the required tools.

* `oc-mirror`: A plugin to the `oc` command for mirorring OpenShift releases, apps / Operators, additional images, and Helm charts

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
cd /mnt/low-side-data/
curl -L -o oc-mirror.tar.gz https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/{openshift_min_version}/oc-mirror.tar.gz
tar -xzf oc-mirror.tar.gz
rm -f oc-mirror.tar.gz
chmod +x oc-mirror
sudo cp -v oc-mirror /bin
----

* `mirror-registry`: a small-scale Red Hat Quay registry designed for mirroring

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
curl -L -o mirror-registry.tar.gz https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/cgw/mirror-registry/latest/mirror-registry-amd64.tar.gz
----

* `openshift-install`: The OpenShift Installer

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
curl -L -o openshift-install.tar.gz https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/{openshift_min_version}/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
tar -xzf openshift-install.tar.gz openshift-install
rm -f openshift-install.tar.gz
----

* `oc`: The OpenShift command line interface

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
curl -L -o oc.tar.gz https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/{openshift_min_version}/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
tar -xzf oc.tar.gz oc
rm -f oc.tar.gz
sudo cp -v oc /bin
----

=== Checkpoint

The commands above asked you to download and extract OpenShift's mirroring and installation tools.
You can verify your work by looking at the files in your __low side transfer directory__ (`/mnt/low-side-data`).
You should see four files in that directory

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
ls -1 /mnt/low-side-data/
----
[.output]
----

=== Mirroring the OpenShift installation images

Now that the mirroring and installation tools have been downloaded and extracted, it's time to put `oc-mirror` to work! Let's start with a brief overview of using `oc-mirror`:

{counter:mirror}. Provide access credentials (a **_pull secret_**)

** Credentials are required to download OpenShift installation images

{counter:mirror}. Create an `ImageSetConfiguration` YAML file that describes:

** What to download (OpenShift itself, an Operator, and an image)
** What versions (e.g. everything between `{openshift_min_version}` and `{openshift_max_version}`)
** Where to store the downloaded content

{counter:mirror}. Run `oc-mirror` with the YAML file

** This process downloads ~25 GB of data and takes about 15 minutes in this workshop environment
** We will run the download in a separate (`tmux`) terminal so that you can keep working.

[NOTE]
--
A **_pull secret_** is JSON-formated data that combines authentication information for one or more Image Registries into a single file.
You can find your own _pull secret_ in the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console,window=_blank].

This workshop provides a generic _pull secret_ in order to avoid delays logging in to the [.underline]#Hybrid Cloud Console# and avoid frustrations using `vi`, `nano` or `emacs`.

More information about _pull secrets_ can be found in the xref:appendix01.adoc#pull-secret[Appendix].
--

Please begin by copying the provided _pull secret_ into the default location.

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute]
----
mkdir -v $HOME/.docker
cp -v $HOME/pull-secret-example.json $HOME/.docker/config.json
----
[.output]
----
mkdir: created directory '/home/lab-user/.docker'
'/home/lab-user/pull-secret-example.json' -> '/home/lab-user/.docker/config.json'
----

Then create an `ImageSetConfiguration` YAML file that tells `oc-mirror` what to downloaded.
A template of this file is provided for you.
To save time and storage, the template downloads:

* Two specific versions of OpenShift
* One optional app / Operator, the `Web Terminal` Operator
* One additional image, `registry.redhat.io/rhel8/support-tools`
* No Helm charts will be download

[TIP]
--
You can find a more detailed https://gist.github.com/kincl/5a269ff3d41632588c9258090a5ea486#file-imageset-config-4-14-yaml[example of an `ImageSetConfig`,window=_blank] in this GitHub Gist.
Please don't make any changes to the provided `ImageSetConfig` because it will increase the amount of time required to download and transfer the content.
--

Create a file called `imageset-config.yaml` with the following contents:

[.lowside,source,yaml,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cat << EOF > /mnt/low-side-data/imageset-config.yaml
---
kind: ImageSetConfiguration

    channels:
    - name: {openshift_channel}
      type: ocp
      minVersion: {openshift_min_version}
      maxVersion: {openshift_max_version}

  operators:
  - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{openshift_version}
    packages:
    - name: web-terminal
      channels:
      - name: fast
  
  additionalImages:
  - name: registry.redhat.io/rhel8/support-tools

  helm: {}
EOF

[WARNING]
--
**It takes ~15 minutes to download the installation images in this workshop environment.**

Please run the next `oc-mirror` command in a `tmux` session.
This will allow you to move on to the next section while `oc-mirror` downloads ~25 GB of data.

Your workshop environment has configured `tmux` to be as user-friendly as possible.
--

Let's create a `tmux` session and begin the `oc-mirror` download.
Run the `tmux` command and see how your terminal is automatically split into two __"panes"__, top and bottom.
You can use your mouse to click and change between the top __pane__ and the bottom __pane__.
You can drag the line that divides the panes to resize them.

If you use your scroll wheel, please press `q` to return to the bottom and continue typing.

[%hardbreaks]
If you get disconnected from tmux, you can re-attach by typing: `tmux attach`

For more information on tmux, xref:appendix-tmux.adoc[check out the Appendix]
--

Now that `tmux` is running, choose one of the _panes_ to run the `oc-mirror` command.
`oc-mirror` is run with an argument to specify the `ImageSetConfig` file and the output URL.

[.lowside,source,bash,role=execute]

=== Summary

This lab's instructions helped you downloaded OpenShift's __mirroring__ and __installation__ tools.
You provided credentials (a `pull secret`) and download instructions (`imageset-config.yaml`) to `oc-mirror`.

Because `oc-mirror` takes a long time to complete, you ran the download command in a `tmux` __pane__.
You can now proceed to the next section and use the other `tmux` __pane__ to keep working without waiting for the download to complete.
